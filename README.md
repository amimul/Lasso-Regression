# Lasso-Regression-
Predicting goodness points of a wine given its reviews.

Implemented Coordinate Descent Algorithm along with Lasso Regression for predicting the goodness points of a wine.

The data was scraped from WineEnthusiast during the week of June 15th, 2017 and can be found on the analytics website Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews). This dataset provides a variety of features, the points, description (review), variety, country, province etc. For this project we used the points and description features. Points are ratings within range 1-100. However, the dataset contains description for wines rated in range 80-100. Feature vectors are already extracted for each review.
